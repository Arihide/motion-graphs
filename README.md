# Motion graphs implementation

Motion graphs is a novel method for creating controllable motion by Lucas Kovar, 2002.

You can try [here](https://arihide.github.io/motion-graphs/dist/)  
Then, 
1. click `Construct motion graph` button and wait
2. select path from `Objective curves`
3. click `Synthesize path` and wait

This implementation is incomplete.
I need to  
- make smooth transition
- remove foot-slide
- get better motion graph search and construction performance
- make nice GUI
